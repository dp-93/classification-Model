## Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses a dataset of Titanic passengers to predict whether a person survived or not based on their features. This is a classic classification problem that involves data cleaning and feature engineering.

* **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
* **Final Accuracy on Test Set:** 78.09%

### Key Skills Demonstrated:
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing `NaN` values in the 'age' column by filling them with the median age.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Converted the 'sex' column to numerical values (0/1).
    * Applied one-hot encoding to the 'embarked' column to convert it into a usable numerical format.
* **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * Used a train-test split to ensure the model was evaluated on unseen data.
    * Calculated the accuracy score to measure the model's performance.
